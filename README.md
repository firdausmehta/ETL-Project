# ETL-Project
The objective is to perform the ETL(Extract-Transform-Load) process by reading the dataset of Trending YouTube videos obtained from Kaggle, cleaning the dataset in the desired form and loading it into a database for storage.

<h3>Data Source:</h3>https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new

<h3>Methodology:</h3>
We will be looking at Trending YouTube videos across the US and Japan along with the dataset of various categories they belong to. We will perform an ETL on the datasets which can be uploaded into production to determine which categories or videos are most or least popular, depending on number of views, likes, dislikes and comments.
